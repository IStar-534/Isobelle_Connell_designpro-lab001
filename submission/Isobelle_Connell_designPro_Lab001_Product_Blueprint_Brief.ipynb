        "**Situation:**\n",
        "Aspiring builders and engineers, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds or with limited access to traditional workshops and mentors, face challenges in gaining hands-on experience and developing practical skills. Existing online resources can be fragmented, lack real-world application, and aren't always designed with diverse learning needs in mind. This gap hinders their ability to translate theoretical knowledge into tangible projects and confidently pursue careers in these fields.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Task:**\n",
        "Simulate the initial product definition phase for a digital platform that provides accessible, user-centered, and practical project-based learning for aspiring builders and engineers. The goal is to define the core problem, target users, key features, and desired outcomes to inform the development of a product brief, user journey, or interactive prototype.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Action:**\n",
        "We will use the STAR method framework to structure our thinking. We will brainstorm a product idea, define the target user based on the situation, outline the core features that address the user's needs, and envision the expected result of using this platform. We will prioritize usability and accessibility throughout this process, considering diverse learning styles and potential limitations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Expected Result:**\n",
        "A concise product blueprint brief that outlines the core problem, target user, key features, and desired impact of the platform. This brief will serve as a foundational document for further development, including detailed user journeys and interactive prototypes."
